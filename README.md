## Guideline for collaboration
Below are the guidelines for collaborating on this repository:
* All discussions should be done in your task's issues. If there isn't one, create an issue for your task. Try to discuss everything here itself so that others have an idea of what's going on with the project, and can give suggestions as well.
* If you want to use the "Projects" feature, create a new project board for your team containing the names of team members, e.g. "Utkarsh - Atharva".
* If you have some piece of code or some files which you want to commit to the repository, commit it to a new branch named after your task, e.g. "networking".
